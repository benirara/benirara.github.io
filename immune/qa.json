        "question": "How does a mask protect you from the flu?",
        "answer": " Last year, <a style='text-decoration: underline;' target='_blank' href='https://www.livescience.com/3008-fear-flu-don-mask.html'>a CDC study</a> found that wearing face masks and washing hands with alcohol-based sanitizer cut down flu symptoms in a community by half. The flu virus is <a style='text-decoration: underline;' target='_blank' href='https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm'>mainly spread</a> by droplets expelled from the mouths and noses of infected people when they cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can spray up to six feet away. <a style='text-decoration: underline;' target='_blank' href='https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment/medical-masks-respirators/health-professionals.html'>Health Canada</a> said masks should offer protection equivalent to N95 to be considered effective. Such masks should filter particles one micron in size or smaller, have a 95% filter efficiency, and provide a tight facial seal (less than 10% leak)"
